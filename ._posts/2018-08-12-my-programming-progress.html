<h3>Where I'm at so far...</h3>
<p>I have no idea where to place myself in the spectrum of expertise I see around many job posts which are entry, intermediate and expert and some people make up some 
new levels in between each one. If I had to say how I feel, I'd say good. By good I mean, I'm at least confident in my current position compared to many people 
of my age range that could be competition. On top of that, since I rolled in a degree in school related to programming I'm excited for the future.</p>

<p>I checked out what the school planned to teach the students in the same program as me and I wasn't so impressed. What we are expected to be at least functional 
and confortable using in 3 years are the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, .NET</li>
    <li>Communication skills in a work environment</li>
    <li>Ease of use and setup of linux environments</li>
    <li>Learn how to use google</li>
    <li>Software/Web UI/Graphics/Design</li>
    <li>Basics of algorithm and design patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>That might seem like a load of good stuff, which it is. Don't get me wrong. I'm just saying from the people I know who've done these courses, they just learned 
the basics of all I just listed. My only issue with that, is it took 3 years.</p>

<h3>Why did I make that decision then?</h3>
<p>My decision making was a pretty simple process. I know I love programming and all I want to do is exactly that as a living. The reason I chose this degree, 
even though it feels like I won't learn much from the actual classes, is the environment. All the students, teachers and ressources I'm going to get are for sure 
going to be a ton more useful than the degree itself. We also get to work in our field in between each summer break if we sign up for it. Which I'm definitely going 
to aim for that. We also have to do an internship for our last semester. Which is a 4ish month long period where all you do for school is work at a tech company and 
at the end you write a report on everything following guidelines the school gives you. I truly believe I'll learn a lot and I'm not at all underestimating that degree. 
I can't wait to start and write about it.</p>

<h3>Technologies I'm familiar with and others I'm confidently using daily</h3>
<p>If I were to list all the languages and frameworks I learned how to use during my journey so far it would be far too long. I'll just list the most recent ones 
I've dabbled in and the ones I currently use and am very confident and learning everyday about.</p>

<h3>Familiar technologies</h3>
<ul>
    <li>C#: I used this a lot when making unity3d games</li>
    <li>Java: The first language I've ever actually learned/watched tutorials about</li>
    <li>C: Followed the edx cs50 course for a while</li>
    <li>C++: Learned this simply by curiosity after dabbling in C#</li>
</ul>

<h3>Daily technologies</h3>
<ul>
    <li>HTML, CSS: They pretty much work hand in hand together</li>
    <li>Javascript: I use this for front and back end (NodeJS)</li>
    <li>MongoDB: Simply because it goes well with the whole javascript mean stack</li>
    <li>Express</li>
    <li>Angular</li>
</ul>

<h3>Plan and goals from here on out</h3>
<p>I started this blog for the very reason to hold myself accountable. I feel like I'm not going to hit any block in my journey if I keep varying the way I express 
myself. My plan is to code, draw and write about it all. Maybe I'll include other things in the future if I start getting into something else.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Every week write at least one post about drawing and one about coding</li>
    <li>Every month write one post about my progress as a whole, and what I've learned since.</li>
    <li>Keep this up for at least a year</li>
</ul>

<h3>Plan</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Solidify my current knowledge about the current languages I'm using</li>
    <li>Learn as much as I can about algorithm design and patterns</li>
    <li>Do a minimum of daily work</li>
</ul>
