  Hello and welcome to my first post in my blog. I wanted to start off with one post that shows where I am so far in my main hobbies, drawing and coding. 
  Every day I challenge myself to at least do a bit of both, and more. But we'll get more into that in a bit. As for my progress, drawing has been inconsistent 
  in the past few years and we could say the same for coding. Luckily I've been coding for far longer so the inconsistency doesn't show. Most of the people 
  I talk to about where I'm at are impressed saying stuff like
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Considering (insert circumstance here) you're pretty good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
   I've never been a fan of such because when I was younger I let it get to my head, inflating my ego like crazy! And eventually thinking I was "good enough" or 
   being temporarily satisfied of myself so much that I stopped working on that skill for a while. Luckily my passions never faded, always coming back to sharpen 
   that skill, so on the long term it didn't hurt as much. Contrarily to drawing, which I technically started 4 years ago when a girl I met kept insisting I learn 
   how to draw and wanted to do weekly competitions between us. And I just used the word technically because it's probably the least consistent I've been in anything. 
   We cut contact, I lost my reason.

   Time went by and I grew up a tad bit, pondering about my decisions and many other things, I decided to change for the better. 
   That's when I started really thinking about <b>why</b> I do things and <b>why not</b> to do other things. Which all led me to make a blog called 
   <b>Practical Versatility</b>. I decided on that name simply because I always try to be as logical as possible, and I'm the type of guy that likes stuff to be at 
   least a little efficient. Including my skill set. For sure not all my skills correlate to each other since the reason for starting one thing is passion, the rest 
   pushes me to continue.

   Trying to reach for goals such as becoming a freelancer or making games, one of my hardest challenges was I was always alone. Relying on 
   finding other people to do what I simply never learned how to do. Often giving up after a few attempts because I wasn't proud of my work. I understand at some 
   point I'd need to seek help. But what I struggled with were simple things such as when making a game, example: </p>

   I used some free assets from the unity asset store for this one. Finding them horrible I pushed on to at least finish up that project. After doing a few more 
   horrible looking games, I stopped for a bit moved on to web dev since after all it's way easier to design a website than video game graphics. Realising I only 
   stopped because I'm not good at drawing/modeling 2d/3d objects. Which essentially boils down to, I have no artistic side. Then remembering how fun it was 
   when I started drawing 4 years ago, I decided to move on and start once again a month ago. A little before starting this blog. And I think this is a good shortened 
   version of my story so far.

   My reasons for starting a blog in the first place are many but mainly: exposure, reference for progress, learning by teaching and finally I like having some kind 
   of journal. Since I'm into computers and such might as well do a virtual journal.
