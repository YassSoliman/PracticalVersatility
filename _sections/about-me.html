<p>My name is Yasser Soliman, a 19 year old student. I mainly study web and game development since it requires a lot of creativity, 
and I'm a generally creative person. But I'm also into art which is a subject I talk a lot about in my <a href="https://practicalversatility.com/blog.html" target="_blank">blog</a>. I have been a self-taught programmer ever since I discovered the field at around 10 years old. In the recent years I have taken my studies more seriously and am now enrolled in computer programming at school. I know multiple languages but my current favorite stack is MEAN :
